# Next.js TypeScript Boilerplate Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the Next.js TypeScript Boilerplate! This guide will help you get started with the boilerplate and follow best practices for folder structure, React Query usage, toasts, and more.

### Features

- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Folder structure for better organization
- React Query for data fetching and mutations
- Tailwind for styling
- React-hot-toast for toast notifications
- SEO-friendly Meta component
- Sitemap generation script
- Pre-configured with Husky, Commit lint, ESLint, Lint-staged

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yousufkalim/next-ts-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. **Install and setup Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   yarn install
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
3. **Run in dev mode:**

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

## Folder Structure

The boilerplate follows a structured organization to enhance maintainability and scalability.

- **api:** External API handler functions.
- **assets:** Assets used in the project.
- **components:** Reusable React components.
- **config:** Configuration files, including environment variables.
- **context:** Context API setup for global state management.
- **hooks:** Useful custom hooks.
- **layouts:** Logic to gather components for layout rendering.
- **pages:** Next.js pages.
- **types:** TypeScript types and interfaces.
- **utils:** Utility functions.

## React Query

The boilerplate integrates React Query for efficient data fetching and mutations. Follow the pattern used in the 'todos' page:

- **useQuery:** Fetching data from an API.

  ```typescript
  import { fectAllTodos } from '@api/todos.api';

  // ...

  const { data, refetch, error } = useQuery('todos', fectAllTodos);
  ```

- **useMutation:** Modifying data on the server.

  ```typescript
  import { updateTodo } from '@api/todos.api';

  // ...

  const mutation = useMutation(updateTodo);
  await mutation.mutateAsync({ ...todo, completed: true });
  
  // Invalidate todos so it can refetch all todos
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['todos'] });
  
  // Or you can simply refetch
  refetch();
  ```

## Toast Notifications

For toast notifications, utilize the `react-hot-toast` library. Import and use it in your components:

```typescript
import toast from 'react-hot-toast';

// ...

toast.success('Todo marked as completed!');
```

## SEO Meta Component

Use the 'Meta' component for SEO information, including OG details. Place it at the top of your page components:

```typescript
import Meta from '@components/Meta';

const MyPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Meta title="My Page" description="This is my page." />
      {/* Your page content */}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Sitemap Generation

A script is included to generate a sitemap during the build process. Simply run:

```bash
yarn run build
```

The sitemap will be created in the 'public' folder.

## Additional Tools

The boilerplate comes with pre-configured tools for maintaining code quality:

- **Husky:** Git hooks to automate checks.
- **Commitlint:** Linting commit messages for consistency.
- **ESLint:** JavaScript and TypeScript linting.
- **Lint-staged:** Run ESLint on staged files.
